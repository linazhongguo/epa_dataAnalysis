# Example: Diagnostic test results for 3 animals on multiple days
# Data are Ct values for a test that is performed on these animals
test1 <- c(23,40,19)
(test2 <- c(29,40,26)) #notice putting code in brackets prints it out after

# you can name these vectors - lets make a vector of names and assign them

# assign names to test1 vector

#summing vectors 
#by themselves 
sum(test1)
sum(test2)
#but in combination
test1+test2 # you'll see that in this case the vectors are added 'vertically'
# this differs to 
sum(test1) + sum(test2)
# in this case mean may be more useful - in reality we wouldn't really be doing it this way but just for example

# what happens when these vectors are not the same length

#add a new value to test1

#now that we've added another result to test 1, R does not allow for summing
#part of the advantage of R, internal validation at this level
